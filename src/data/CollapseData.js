        As part of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hyer® only offers aircraft
        from operators that follow strict hygiene guidelines. Those operators
        have put measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus. This
        includes thoroughly disinfection of the aircraft cabin before and after
        the flight. <br />
        <br />
        Apart from that, the flight crew have to wear mouth masks at all times
        during the flight and they will keep a safe distance from the
        passengers. In preparation for your journey, your Flight Manager will
        check the current travel restrictions at your destination and advise you
        if any travel regulations are in place. Flying private with Hyer® is one
        of the safest ways to travel during these times.

        When flying private, you enjoy considerable flexibility for flying with
        luggage. As standard, you receive a very generous luggage allowance
        when booking a private jet. At Hyer®, your Flight Manager will ask you
        about the amount and type of luggage that you would like to bring on
        board. With this information, the Flight Manager Team check if there is
        any limitation or restriction applicable and they will assign the most
        suitable aircraft to you. <br /><br />
        In terms of luggage content, there is no limitation on how much liquids
        you can carry with you. If there is any special or fragile cargo that
        needs to be transported, your Flight Manager will ensure that extra
        measures are taken to deal with your precious belongings. For our
        shared flights, different rules apply.

        Do you want to fly with your pet? No problem! Hyer® offers the
        possibility to bring your pet on board. A suitable aircraft, pet
        friendly, will be assigned for your flight. <br /><br />
        You avoid the stress and the worries of your pet being placed on an
        aircraft cargo hold, surrounded by heavy luggage and cargo. As a
        standard, when flying private, your pet will need to be transported in
        animal carriages boxes. However, they will be flying next to you in the
        aircraft's main cabin. Oh, and besides, we might even have a small
        treat for them.
